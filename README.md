# beggining-tetris-project

Purpose behind the project

In the past about 7 years ago I decided to create a platformer game in java for a high school project.
And although a general audience would consider it to be impressive, I believe that I can write an application where I could simply do the code better. 
Asides from that Iâ€™d rather talk about something that I have done recently as a college student rather than what I have done during high school.
So, I figured coding Tetris in python was appropriate since I like the game, to begin with, and I can prove that not only can I code but I can write 
an application that is reasonably readable.

total hours spent on the project: 13

Running the project in the pycharm IDE

Assuming that whoever opens this has the PyCharm IDE installed. To simply run the project the first thing that needs to be done is to go into 
file>settings>project>python interpreter> then click the plus to add the pygame package. From there it should be as simple as clicking and 
dragging all the files into the project folder and running it from the main.py file(everything you need should be in the day 6 folder)

controls:
arrow keys to move the piece
c and v to rotate your piece
